# SoccerNet - Tracking

Welcome to the SoccerNet Development Kit for the Tracking Task and Challenge. This kit is meant as a help to get started working with the data and the proposed task. More information about the dataset can be found on our [official website](https://soccer-net.org/).

The Tracking dataset consists of 12 complete soccer games from the main camera including:
 - 200 clips of 30 seconds with tracking data.
 - one complete halftime annotated with tracking data.
 - the complete videos for the 12 games.
